displayName: Checkstyle Sanity Check
description: |
  High-level chained recipe that enforces consistent, correct, and maintainable Java code.
  This recipe bundles multiple static analysis and cleanup checks, license header enforcement,
  and import normalization.
  It also integrates automated fixes for common Checkstyle violations and applies Refaster &
  Error Prone rules to prevent subtle bugs.

  In practice, this means it will:
  - Remove unused imports, variables, fields, and methods.
  - Enforce standard package naming, annotation usage, and modifier order.
  - Disallow problematic constructs like finalizers.
  - Normalize code layout and style for readability.
  - Apply curated Refaster and Error Prone rule sets

  The goal is to catch common mistakes early, ensure uniform style across the codebase, and reduce
  maintenance overhead without requiring manual fixes.
