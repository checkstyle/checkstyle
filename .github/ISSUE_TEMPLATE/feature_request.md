I have downloaded the latest cli from: https://checkstyle.org/cmdline.html#Download_and_Run
I have executed the cli and showed it below, as cli describes the problem better than 1,000 words

**How it works Now:**

```bash
/var/tmp $ javac YOUR_FILE.java
#[[MAKE SURE THERE IS SUCCESSFUL COMPILATION]]

/var/tmp $ cat config.xml
#[[PLACE YOUR OUTPUT HERE]]

/var/tmp $ cat YOUR_FILE.java
#[[PLACE YOU OUTPUT HERE]]

/var/tmp $ RUN_LOCALE="-Duser.language=en -Duser.country=US"
/var/tmp $ java $RUN_LOCALE -jar checkstyle-X.XX-all.jar -c config.xml YOUR_FILE.java
#[[PLACE YOUR OUTPUT HERE]]
```
