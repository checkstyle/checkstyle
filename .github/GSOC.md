## Getting Started

Thanks for your interest in participating in GSoC with Checkstyle! Joining Checkstyle for the summer
is a great way to learn about open source software development and contribute to a widely-used
project. We are excited to work with you and help you grow as a software developer. You don't
need to be an expert in Java or Checkstyle to participate. We are looking for participants who are
eager to learn, work hard, and are excited to contribute to open source software. Additionally, we
want you to stick around after GSoC and become a long-term member of our community :smile:.

Please take the time to read through this guide and familiarize yourself with the project. If you
have any questions, please don't hesitate to ask. We are here to help you succeed. If you have
not already done so, please read through the following documentation provided by Google:

- [GSoC Participant Guide](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/rules/).
- [GSoC FAQ](https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/faq).

### Recommended Steps

- **Get to know the project.** Spend some time reading through the Checkstyle documentation and
  familiarizing yourself with the project. You can find the documentation at
  [https://checkstyle.org/](https://checkstyle.org/).
- **Join the Checkstyle community.**
  Join the Checkstyle group on [Gitter](https://gitter.im/checkstyle/checkstyle).
  This is a great place to ask questions and get to know the community.
  Join the Checkstyle group on [Google Groups](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/checkstyle).
  This is another place to ask questions and get to know the community.
- **Start contributing.** We have a list of issues labeled as
  https://github.com/checkstyle/checkstyle/labels/good%20first%20issue. These are a great place to
  start. Once you complete a few of these, you will have a better understanding of the project and
  be ready to move on to https://github.com/checkstyle/checkstyle/labels/good%20second%20issue,
  and so on. Once you have completed a few of these, you will be ready to start working on some
  more challenging issues, like bug fixes and new features.
- **Take a Look at Our Project Ideas.** We have a list of project ideas that we think would be
  great for GSoC. You can find them in our wiki [Checkstyle Wiki](https://github.com/checkstyle/checkstyle/wiki).
  You can also propose your own project idea. We are open to new ideas and would love to hear
  what you are interested in working on.
- **Create a Draft Proposal.** Once you have a good understanding of the project and have an idea
  of what you would like to work on, create a draft proposal. We are happy to help you refine your
  proposal and provide feedback. The best way to share your draft proposal is through Google docs.
- **Submit Your Proposal.** Now that you have refined your proposal, submit it through the
  GSoC website **before the final submission deadline**.

## Additional Tips

- **Start Early.** The earlier you start, the more time you will have to get to know the project,
    accumulate contributions, and refine your proposal.
- **Communicate Effectively.** We are looking for participants who can communicate effectively. This
    includes using clear and concise language, being responsive to feedback, and being proactive.
- **Contribute, Contribute, Contribute.** This is the single best way to show us that you are
    serious becoming a valuable member of our community.

## Your Proposal

Your proposal is your opportunity to show us that you are the right person for the job. To this end,
we have provided a list of things that we would like to see in your proposal. We are not looking for
a long proposal, but we are looking for a well-thought-out proposal that shows us that you have
taken the time to understand the project and have a clear plan for how you will contribute.

### Proposal Outline

#### Introduction

All projects aim to solve a problem or improve something. Start your proposal by introducing the
problem you are trying to solve or the improvement you are trying to make. This is your opportunity
to show us that you understand the problem, why it is important, and why it is worth solving.
Include any relevant background information that will help us understand the problem, like
statistics, examples, references to existing issues, etc.

#### Project Goals

This should be concise and to the point. What are you trying to accomplish? What are the
deliverables? What are the success criteria? What are the key milestones? Effective goals are
specific, measurable, and achievable. This section may be a bulleted list or outline.

#### Implementation Plan

Describe your solution to the problem. This should include a high-level overview of the
architecture, a list of tasks, and a list of potential challenges, as well as some technical
details. We want to see that you have thought through the problem and can visualize how you will
solve it.

#### Timeline

Show us that you can break down your project into manageable tasks and that you have a clear plan
for how you will accomplish your goals. This should be a timeline that shows what you will be
working on each week. It should include milestones and deliverables. An effective way to present
this is in a table.

#### About You

Tell us about yourself. what time zone are you located in?
What is your background? What are your interests?
What are your career goals?
This is your opportunity to show us that you are a good fit for the project and that
you are excited to work with us. **You must include a list of links to your Checkstyle contributions
to be considered for GSoC; this is one of the most important selection criteria.**

### Proposal Tips

- Be Specific. We want to see that you have thought through the problem and
  how you will solve it.
- Be Realistic. We are looking for a proposal that is achievable in the time frame of GSoC.
  We want to see that you have a clear plan.
- Be Professional. We are looking for a proposal that is well-written and professional.
- One Proposal <-> One Project. Do not create a proposal that spans multiple projects.
- Proposal Title. If creating a proposal based on our project ideas, please use the title of the
  project idea as the title of your proposal. If you are proposing your own project idea, please
  create a title that is descriptive and concise.
