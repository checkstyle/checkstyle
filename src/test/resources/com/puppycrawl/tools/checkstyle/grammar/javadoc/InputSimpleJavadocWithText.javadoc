* If a visit method is not overridden, we should explain why we do not 'visit' the
* parse tree at this node and construct an AST. Reasons could include that we have
* no terminal symbols (tokens) in the corresponding production rule, or that
* we handle the construction of this particular AST in its parent node. If we
* have a production rule where we have terminal symbols (tokens), but we do not build
* an AST from tokens in the rule context, the rule is extraneous.
