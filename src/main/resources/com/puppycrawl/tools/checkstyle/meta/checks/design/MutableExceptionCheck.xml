 Ensures that exception classes (classes with names conforming to some regular
 expression and explicitly extending classes with names conforming to other
 regular expression) are immutable, that is, that they have only final fields.
 </p>
 <p>
 The current algorithm is very simple: it checks that all members of exception are final.
 The user can still mutate an exception's instance (e.g. Throwable has a method called
 {@code setStackTrace} which changes the exception's stack trace). But, at least, all
 information provided by this exception type is unchangeable.
 </p>
 <p>
 Rationale: Exception instances should represent an error
 condition. Having non final fields not only allows the state to be
 modified by accident and therefore mask the original condition but
 also allows developers to accidentally forget to set the initial state.
 In both cases, code catching the exception could draw incorrect
 conclusions based on the state.
