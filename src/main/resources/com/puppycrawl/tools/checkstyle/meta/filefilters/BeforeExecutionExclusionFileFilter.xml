 File filter {@code BeforeExecutionExclusionFileFilter} decides which files should be
 excluded from being processed by the utility.
 &lt;/div&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;
 By default, Checkstyle includes all files and subdirectories in a directory to be processed and
 checked for violations. Users could have files that are in these subdirectories that shouldn't
 be processed with their checkstyle configuration for various reasons, one of which is a valid
 Java file that won't pass Checkstyle's parser. When Checkstyle tries to parse a Java file and
 fails, it will throw an {@code Exception} and halt parsing any more files for violations.
 An example of a valid Java file Checkstyle can't parse is JDK 9's {@code module-info.java}.
 This file filter will exclude these problem files from being parsed, allowing the rest of the
 files to run normal and be validated.
 &lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;
 &lt;b&gt;Note:&lt;/b&gt; When a file is excluded from the utility, it is excluded from all Checks and no
 testing for violations will be performed on them.
