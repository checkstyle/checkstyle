 Checks for redundant modifiers.
 </p>
 <p>
 Rationale: The Java Language Specification strongly discourages the usage
 of {@code public} and {@code abstract} for method declarations in interface
 definitions as a matter of style.
 </p>
 <p>The check validates:</p>
 <ol>
 <li>
 Interface and annotation definitions.
 </li>
 <li>
 Final modifier on methods of final and anonymous classes.
 </li>
 <li>
 Inner {@code interface} declarations that are declared as {@code static}.
 </li>
 <li>
 Class constructors.
 </li>
 <li>
 Nested {@code enum} definitions that are declared as {@code static}.
 </li>
 </ol>
 <p>
 Interfaces by definition are abstract so the {@code abstract}
 modifier on the interface is redundant.
 </p>
 <p>Classes inside of interfaces by definition are public and static,
 so the {@code public} and {@code static} modifiers
 on the inner classes are redundant. On the other hand, classes
 inside of interfaces can be abstract or non abstract.
 So, {@code abstract} modifier is allowed.
 </p>
 <p>Fields in interfaces and annotations are automatically
 public, static and final, so these modifiers are redundant as
 well.</p>

 <p>As annotations are a form of interface, their fields are also
 automatically public, static and final just as their
 annotation fields are automatically public and abstract.</p>

 <p>Enums by definition are static implicit subclasses of java.lang.Enum&#60;E&#62;.
 So, the {@code static} modifier on the enums is redundant. In addition,
 if enum is inside of interface, {@code public} modifier is also redundant.</p>

 <p>Enums can also contain abstract methods and methods which can be overridden by the declared
 enumeration fields.
 See the following example:</p>
 <pre>
 public enum EnumClass {
   FIELD_1,
   FIELD_2 {
     &#64;Override
     public final void method1() {} // violation expected
   };

   public void method1() {}
   public final void method2() {} // no violation expected
 }
 </pre>

 <p>Since these methods can be overridden in these situations, the final methods are not
 marked as redundant even though they can't be extended by other classes/enums.</p>
 <p>
 Nested {@code enum} types are always static by default.
 </p>
 <p>Final classes by definition cannot be extended so the {@code final}
 modifier on the method of a final class is redundant.
 </p>
 <p>Public modifier for constructors in non-public non-protected classes
 is always obsolete: </p>

 <pre>
 public class PublicClass {
   public PublicClass() {} // OK
 }

 class PackagePrivateClass {
   public PackagePrivateClass() {} // violation expected
 }
 </pre>

 <p>There is no violation in the following example,
 because removing public modifier from ProtectedInnerClass
 constructor will make this code not compiling: </p>

 <pre>
 package a;
 public class ClassExample {
   protected class ProtectedInnerClass {
     public ProtectedInnerClass () {}
   }
 }

 package b;
 import a.ClassExample;
 public class ClassExtending extends ClassExample {
   ProtectedInnerClass pc = new ProtectedInnerClass();
 }
 </pre>]]></description>
