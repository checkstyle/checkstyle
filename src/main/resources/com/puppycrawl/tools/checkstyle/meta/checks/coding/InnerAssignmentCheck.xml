 Checks for assignments in subexpressions, such as in
 {@code String s = Integer.toString(i = 2);}.
 &lt;/div&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;
 Rationale: Except for the loop idioms,
 all assignments should occur in their own top-level statement to increase readability.
 With inner assignments like the one given above, it is difficult to see all places
 where a variable is set.
 &lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;
 Note: Check allows usage of the popular assignments in loops:
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;pre&gt;
 String line;
 while ((line = bufferedReader.readLine()) != null) { // OK
   // process the line
 }

 for (;(line = bufferedReader.readLine()) != null;) { // OK
   // process the line
 }

 do {
   // process the line
 }
 while ((line = bufferedReader.readLine()) != null); // OK
 &lt;/pre&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;
 Assignment inside a condition is not a problem here, as the assignment is surrounded
 by an extra pair of parentheses. The comparison is {@code != null} and there is no chance that
 intention was to write {@code line == reader.readLine()}.
