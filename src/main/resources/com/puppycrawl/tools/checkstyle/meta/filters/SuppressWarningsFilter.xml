 Filter {@code SuppressWarningsFilter} uses annotation
 {@code SuppressWarnings} to suppress audit events.
 </p>
 <p>
 Rationale: Same as for {@code SuppressionCommentFilter}. In the contrary to it here,
 comments are not used comments but the builtin syntax of {@code @SuppressWarnings}.
 This can be perceived as a more elegant solution than using comments.
 Also this approach maybe supported by various IDE.
 </p>
 <p>
 Usage: This filter only works in conjunction with a
 <a href="https://checkstyle.org/config_annotation.html#SuppressWarningsHolder">
 SuppressWarningsHolder</a>,
 since that check finds the annotations in the Java files and makes them available for the filter.
 Because of that, a configuration that includes this filter must also include
 {@code SuppressWarningsHolder} as a child module of the {@code TreeWalker}.
 Name of check in annotation is case-insensitive and should be written with
 any dotted prefix or "Check" suffix removed.
 </p>
 <p>
 SuppressWarningsFilter can suppress Checks that have Treewalker or
 Checker as parent module.
