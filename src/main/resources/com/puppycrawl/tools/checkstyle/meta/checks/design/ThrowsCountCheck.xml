      <description>&lt;div&gt;
 Restricts throws statements to a specified count.
 Methods with "Override" or "java.lang.Override" annotation are skipped
 from validation as current class cannot change signature of these methods.
 &lt;/div&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;
 Rationale:
 Exceptions form part of a method's interface. Declaring
 a method to throw too many differently rooted
 exceptions makes exception handling onerous and leads
 to poor programming practices such as writing code like
 {@code catch(Exception ex)}. 4 is the empirical value which is based
 on reports that we had for the ThrowsCountCheck over big projects
 such as OpenJDK. This check also forces developers to put exceptions
 into a hierarchy such that in the simplest
 case, only one type of exception need be checked for by
 a caller but any subclasses can be caught
 specifically if necessary. For more information on rules
 for the exceptions and their issues, see Effective Java:
 Programming Language Guide Second Edition
 by Joshua Bloch pages 264-273.
 &lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;
 &lt;b&gt;ignorePrivateMethods&lt;/b&gt; - allows to skip private methods as they do
 not cause problems for other classes.
