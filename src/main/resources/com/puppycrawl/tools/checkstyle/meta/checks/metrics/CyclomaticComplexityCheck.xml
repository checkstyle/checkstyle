 Checks cyclomatic complexity against a specified limit. It is a measure of
 the minimum number of possible paths through the source and therefore the
 number of required tests, it is not a about quality of code! It is only
 applied to methods, c-tors,
 &lt;a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/javaOO/initial.html"&gt;
 static initializers and instance initializers&lt;/a&gt;.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
 The complexity is equal to the number of decision points {@code + 1}.
 Decision points: {@code if}, {@code while}, {@code do}, {@code for},
 {@code ?:}, {@code catch}, {@code switch}, {@code case} statements and
 operators {@code &amp;amp;&amp;amp;} and {@code ||} in the body of target.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
 By pure theory level 1-4 is considered easy to test, 5-7 OK, 8-10 consider
 re-factoring to ease testing, and 11+ re-factor now as testing will be painful.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
 When it comes to code quality measurement by this metric level 10 is very
 good level as a ultimate target (that is hard to archive). Do not be ashamed
 to have complexity level 15 or even higher, but keep it below 20 to catch
 really bad designed code automatically.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
 Please use Suppression to avoid violations on cases that could not be split
 in few methods without damaging readability of code or encapsulation.
