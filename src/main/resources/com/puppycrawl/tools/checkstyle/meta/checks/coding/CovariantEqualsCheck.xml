 Checks that classes and records which define a covariant {@code equals()} method
 also override method {@code equals(Object)}.
 </p>
 <p>
 Covariant {@code equals()} - method that is similar to {@code equals(Object)},
 but with a covariant parameter type (any subtype of Object).
 </p>
 <p>
 <strong>Notice</strong>: the enums are also checked,
 even though they cannot override {@code equals(Object)}.
 The reason is to point out that implementing {@code equals()} in enums
 is considered an awful practice: it may cause having two different enum values
 that are equal using covariant enum method, and not equal when compared normally.
 </p>
 <p>
 Inspired by <a href="https://www.cs.jhu.edu/~daveho/pubs/oopsla2004.pdf">
 Finding Bugs is Easy, chapter '4.5 Bad Covariant Definition of Equals (Eq)'</a>:
 </p>
 <p>
 Java classes and records may override the {@code equals(Object)} method to define
 a predicate for object equality. This method is used by many of the Java
 runtime library classes; for example, to implement generic containers.
 </p>
 <p>
 Programmers sometimes mistakenly use the type of their class {@code Foo}
 as the type of the parameter to {@code equals()}:
 </p>
 <pre>
 public boolean equals(Foo obj) {...}
 </pre>
 <p>
 This covariant version of {@code equals()} does not override the version in
 the {@code Object} class, and it may lead to unexpected behavior at runtime,
 especially if the class is used with one of the standard collection classes
 which expect that the standard {@code equals(Object)} method is overridden.
 </p>
 <p>
 This kind of bug is not obvious because it looks correct, and in circumstances
 where the class is accessed through the references of the class type (rather
 than a supertype), it will work correctly. However, the first time it is used
 in a container, the behavior might be mysterious. For these reasons, this type
 of bug can elude testing and code inspections.
