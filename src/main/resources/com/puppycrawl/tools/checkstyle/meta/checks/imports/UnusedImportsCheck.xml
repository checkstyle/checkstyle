 Checks for unused import statements. Checkstyle uses a simple but very
 reliable algorithm to report on unused import statements. An import statement
 is considered unused if:
 </p>
 <ul>
 <li>
 It is not referenced in the file. The algorithm does not support wild-card
 imports like {@code import java.io.*;}. Most IDE's provide very sophisticated
 checks for imports that handle wild-card imports.
 </li>
 <li>
 It is a duplicate of another import. This is when a class is imported more
 than once.
 </li>
 <li>
 The class imported is from the {@code java.lang} package. For example
 importing {@code java.lang.String}.
 </li>
 <li>
 The class imported is from the same package.
 </li>
 <li>
 <b>Optionally:</b> it is referenced in Javadoc comments. This check is on by
 default, but it is considered bad practice to introduce a compile time
 dependency for documentation purposes only. As an example, the import
 {@code java.util.List} would be considered referenced with the Javadoc
 comment {@code {@link List}}. The alternative to avoid introducing a compile
 time dependency would be to write the Javadoc comment as {@code {&#64;link java.util.List}}.
 </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
 The main limitation of this check is handling the case where an imported type
 has the same name as a declaration, such as a member variable.
 </p>
 <p>
 For example, in the following case the import {@code java.awt.Component}
 will not be flagged as unused:
 </p>
 <pre>
 import java.awt.Component;
 class FooBar {
   private Object Component; // a bad practice in my opinion
   ...
 }
 </pre>]]></description>
