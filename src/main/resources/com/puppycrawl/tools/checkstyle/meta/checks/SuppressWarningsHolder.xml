 Maintains a set of check suppressions from {@code @SuppressWarnings} annotations.
 It allows to prevent Checkstyle from reporting violations from parts of code that were
 annotated with {@code @SuppressWarnings} and using name of the check to be excluded.
 It is possible to suppress all the checkstyle warnings with the argument {@code "all"}.
 You can also use a {@code checkstyle:} prefix to prevent compiler
 from processing these annotations.
 You can also define aliases for check names that need to be suppressed.
