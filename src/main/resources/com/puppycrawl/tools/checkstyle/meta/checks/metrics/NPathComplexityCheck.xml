 Checks the NPATH complexity against a specified limit.
 </p>
 <p>
 The NPATH metric computes the number of possible execution paths through a
 function(method). It takes into account the nesting of conditional statements
 and multi-part boolean expressions (A &amp;&amp; B, C || D, E ? F :G and
 their combinations).
 </p>
 <p>
 The NPATH metric was designed base on Cyclomatic complexity to avoid problem
 of Cyclomatic complexity metric like nesting level within a function(method).
 </p>
 <p>
 Metric was described at <a href="http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=42379">
 "NPATH: a measure of execution pathcomplexity and its applications"</a>.
 If you need detailed description of algorithm, please read that article,
 it is well written and have number of examples and details.
 </p>
 <p>
 Here is some quotes:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
 An NPATH threshold value of 200 has been established for a function.
 The value 200 is based on studies done at AT&amp;T Bell Laboratories [1988 year].
 </blockquote>
 <blockquote>
 Some of the most effective methods of reducing the NPATH value include:
 <ul>
 <li>
 distributing functionality;
 </li>
 <li>
 implementing multiple if statements as a switch statement;
 </li>
 <li>
 creating a separate function for logical expressions with a high count of
 variables and (&amp;&amp;) and or (||) operators.
 </li>
 </ul>
 </blockquote>
 <blockquote>
 Although strategies to reduce the NPATH complexity of functions are important,
 care must be taken not to distort the logical clarity of the software by
 applying a strategy to reduce the complexity of functions. That is, there is
 a point of diminishing return beyond which a further attempt at reduction of
 complexity distorts the logical clarity of the system structure.

 <b>Rationale:</b> Nejmeh says that his group had an informal NPATH limit of
 200 on individual routines; functions(methods) that exceeded this value were
 candidates for further decomposition - or at least a closer look.
 <b>Please do not be fanatic with limit 200</b> - choose number that suites
 your project style. Limit 200 is empirical number base on some sources of at
 AT&amp;T Bell Laboratories of 1988 year.
