 Checks whether files end with a line separator.
 </p>
 <p>
 Rationale: Any source files and text files in general should end with a line
 separator to let other easily add new content at the end of file and "diff"
 command does not show previous lines as changed.
 </p>
 <p>
 Example (line 36 should not be in diff):
 </p>
 <pre>
 &#64;&#64; -32,4 +32,5 &#64;&#64; ForbidWildcardAsReturnTypeCheck.returnTypeClassNamesIgnoreRegex
 PublicReferenceToPrivateTypeCheck.name = Public Reference To Private Type

 StaticMethodCandidateCheck.name = Static Method Candidate
 -StaticMethodCandidateCheck.desc = Checks whether private methods should be declared as static.
 \ No newline at end of file
 +StaticMethodCandidateCheck.desc = Checks whether private methods should be declared as static.
 +StaticMethodCandidateCheck.skippedMethods = Method names to skip during the check.
 </pre>
 <p>
 It can also trick the VCS to report the wrong owner for such lines.
 An engineer who has added nothing but a newline character becomes the last
 known author for the entire line. As a result, a mate can ask him a question
 to which he will not give the correct answer.
 </p>
 <p>
 Old Rationale: CVS source control management systems will even print
 a warning when it encounters a file that doesn't end with a line separator.
 </p>
 <p>
 Attention: property fileExtensions works with files that are passed by similar
 property for at <a href="https://checkstyle.org/config.html#Checker">Checker</a>.
 Please make sure required file extensions are mentioned at Checker's fileExtensions property.
 </p>
 <p>
 This will check against the platform-specific default line separator.
 </p>
 <p>
 It is also possible to enforce the use of a specific line-separator across
 platforms, with the {@code lineSeparator} property.
