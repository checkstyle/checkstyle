arrangement.members.before.inner=Init blocks, constructors, fields and methods should be before inner types.
design.forExtension=The class ''{0}'' looks like designed for extension (can be subclassed), but the \
  method ''{1}'' does not have Javadoc that explains how to do that safely. If the class ''{0}'' is not \
  designed for extension, consider making it final or making the method ''{1}'' \
  static, final, abstract or empty, or perhaps add the allowed annotation for the method.
final.class=The class ''{0}'' should be declared as final.
hide.utility.class=Utility classes should not have a public or package-default constructor.
interface.type=Interfaces should describe a type and hence have methods.
mutable.exception=The field ''{0}'' should be declared final.
one.top.level.class=The top-level class ''{0}'' has to reside in its own source file.
throws.count=The count of \"throws\" clauses is {0,number,integer}, but the maximum allowed is {1,number,integer}.
variable.notPrivate=The variable ''{0}'' must be private and have accessor methods.
