/**
 * <p>
 * Filter {@code SuppressWarningsFilter} uses annotation
 * {@code @SuppressWarnings} to suppress audit events.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Rationale: Same as for {@code SuppressionCommentFilter}. In the contrary to it here,
 * comments are not used comments but the builtin syntax of {@code @SuppressWarnings}.
 * This can be perceived as a more elegant solution than using comments.
 * Also, this approach maybe supported by various IDE.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Usage: This filter only works in conjunction with a
 * <a href="https://checkstyle.org/checks/annotation/suppresswarningsholder.html#SuppressWarningsHolder">
 * SuppressWarningsHolder</a>,
 * since that check finds the annotations in the Java files and makes them available for the filter.
 * Because of that, a configuration that includes this filter must also include
 * {@code SuppressWarningsHolder} as a child module of the {@code TreeWalker}.
 * Name of check in annotation is case-insensitive and should be written with
 * any dotted prefix or "Check" suffix removed.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * SuppressWarningsFilter can suppress Checks that have Treewalker or
 * Checker as parent module.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Parent is {@code com.puppycrawl.tools.checkstyle.Checker}
 * </p>
