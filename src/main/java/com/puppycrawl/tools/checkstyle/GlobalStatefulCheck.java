/**
 * This annotation means that the check contains global context,
 * which will be updated while Checkstyle processes files. This also means,
 * that all files will be processed by the same check instance.
 * This annotation should be used, if a check accumulates some information during the audit,
 * and processed only once at the end of the audit (however, the check still
 * can produce some messages, while collecting information).
 * The check methods and fields should be thread safe, because they may be accessed from others
 * threads at the same time.
 * Checker guarantees that there will be exactly one check instance
 * This is similar to multi-file validation, which checkstyle does not support fully yet.
 * Please refer to https://github.com/checkstyle/checkstyle/issues/3540 for details.
 * @noinspection AnnotationClass, ClassIndependentOfModule, unused, ClassOnlyUsedInOnePackage
