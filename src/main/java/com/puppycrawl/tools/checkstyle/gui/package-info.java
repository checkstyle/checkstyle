/**
 * User interface classes for CheckStyle. Currently this is mainly a gui to aid
 * Check developers.
 *
 * <p>This is definitely work in progress. Here are some ideas where
 * <strong>you</strong> could help:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>
 *     Add a read only editor field that highlights the selected AST node.
 *   </li>
 *   <li>
 *     Clicking in the editor field could open the corresponding tree path.
 *   </li>
 *   <li>
 *     Add a configuration GUI that can be used in all IDE plugins
 *     (well, err.., except Eclipse).
 *   </li>
 *   <li>
 *     Add ability to execute individual Checks and display the error messages.
 *   </li>
 *   <li>
 *     Add a GUI for the
 *     {@link com.puppycrawl.tools.checkstyle.api.FileContents}.
 *   </li>
 *   <li>
 *     Add ability to define a Check by example (another one of those crazy
 *     ideas... :-)
 *   </li>
 * </ul>
