        Hey, good to see you on this page. It means that you are considering reporting an issue to the Checkstyle
        project. We welcome anything: bug reports, feature requests to existing functionality, new Check ideas, etc.
      </p>

      <p>
        Our issue tracker system is at Github - <a href="https://github.com/checkstyle/checkstyle/issues">
        https://github.com/checkstyle/checkstyle/issues</a>.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section name="How to report a bug?">

      <p>
        First and foremost, do not think that your issue is obvious and do not need details.<br/>
        Even tiny issue need all details
        (Check name, config with options, source file, Checkstyle version) and context to be shared with us.
      </p>

      <p>
        The best way to report an Issue is to reproduce it by our <a href="cmdline.html#Download_and_Run">
        Command Line Interface (CLI)</a>. It is the most minimalistic way to launch Checkstyle.<br/>
        PLEASE use our latest released version.
      </p>

      <p>
        Our project is NOT responsible for problems at any extension or plugins.<br/>
        Checkstyle is library that is used by number of IDEs and static analysis services.<br/>
        We fix problems that are only reproducible on latest release.
      </p>

      <p>
        We need minimized but compilable Java file and minimized config with one Check that cause problem.<br/>
        We do not need real source code. Any obfuscation of your super secret code is OK.<br/>
        Link to your source code would be awesome. 
        Code has to be compilable, in other case behaviour could be strange.
      </p>

      <p>
        Example of report that we expect:

        <source><![CDATA[
/var/tmp $ javac Test.java


/var/tmp $ cat Test.java
public class Test{ // Doesn't warn - incorrect
private static final int SOMETHING = 1;
}

/var/tmp $ cat config.xml
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<!DOCTYPE module PUBLIC
        "-//Puppy Crawl//DTD Check Configuration 1.3//EN"
        "http://www.puppycrawl.com/dtds/configuration_1_3.dtd">
<module name="Checker">
    <module name="TreeWalker">
        <module name="WhitespaceAround">
            <property name="allowEmptyTypes" value="true"/>
        </module>
    </module>
</module>

/var/tmp $ java -jar checkstyle-6.XX-all.jar -c config.xml Test.java
Starting audit...
Audit done.

        ]]></source>
      </p>

      <p>
        Always specify what is expected.<br/>

        <code>
          Expected: violation on first line.
          /var/tmp/Test.java:1:28: error: '{' is not preceded with whitespace.
        </code>
      </p>

      <p>
        Please always specify exact name of the Check/Module.
      </p>

      <p>
        Please provide detailed description of problem and chunks of code and config that you currently have.
      </p>

      <p>
        Imagine that everithing is possible and propose name of the new option and its behaviour. Do not think that your issue is so obvious.
