        Hey, good to see you on this page. It means that you are considering reporting an
        issue to the Checkstyle project. We welcome anything: bug reports, feature requests
        to existing functionality, new Check ideas, etc.
      </p>

      <p>
        Our issue tracker system is at Github -
        <a href="https://github.com/checkstyle/checkstyle/issues">
        https://github.com/checkstyle/checkstyle/issues</a>.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section name="How to report a bug?">

      <p>
        First and foremost, do not think that your issue is obvious and doesn't need details.<br/>
        Even tiny issues need all details
        (Check name, config with options, source file, Checkstyle version) and context to be
        shared with us.
      </p>

      <p>
        The best way to report an Issue is to reproduce it by our
        <a href="cmdline.html#Download_and_Run">
        Command Line Interface (CLI)</a>. It is the most minimalistic way to launch Checkstyle.<br/>
        PLEASE use our latest released version.
      </p>

      <p>
        Our project is NOT responsible for problems at any extension or plugins.<br/>
        Checkstyle is library that is used by number of IDEs and static analysis services.<br/>
        We fix problems that are only reproducible on latest release.
      </p>

      <p>
        We need minimized but compilable Java file and minimized config with one Check
        that cause problem.<br/>
        We do not need real source code. Any obfuscation of your super secret code is OK.<br/>
        Link to your source code would be awesome.
        Code has to be compilable, in other case behaviour could be strange.
      </p>

      <p>
        Example of report that we expect (you can skip <code>-Duser.language=en
        -Duser.country=US</code> if your default locale is English):

        <source><![CDATA[
Check documentation: https://checkstyle.org/config_whitespace.html#WhitespaceAround

/var/tmp $ javac Test.java

/var/tmp $ cat Test.java
public class Test{ // Doesn't warn - incorrect
private static final int SOMETHING = 1;
}

/var/tmp $ cat config.xml
<?xml version="1.0"?>

      </p>

      <p>
        Always specify what is expected.<br/>

        <code>
          Expected: violation on first line.
          /var/tmp/Test.java:1:28: error: '{' is not preceded with whitespace.
        </code>

    <section name="How to request enhancement to existing functionality?">

      <p>
        Please always specify exact name of the Check/Module.
      </p>

      <p>
        Please provide a clear and detailed description of theproblem and describe what
        you would want to happen instead. Relevant chunks of code and config that you currently
        have will definitely facilitate understanding. Any other context or
        screenshots which elaborate futher on the relevence and rational behind
        the new feature may also be added.
      </p>

      <p>
        A clear and concise description of any alternative or existing
        solution or feature that you may've considered or seen elsewhere.
      </p>

      <p>
        Imagine that everything is possible and propose name of the new option and its
        describe its behaviour.
        Never think that your issue is obvious.

Check documentation: https://checkstyle.org/config_whitespace.html#WhitespaceAround

Describe the problem in detail:

/var/tmp $ javac Test.java

/var/tmp $ cat Test.java
public class Test { // Note
  private static final int SOMETHING = 1;
}

Describe how the additional functionality will solve the problem:

    <section name="How to request new Check/Module?">
      <p>
        Please provide detailed description of problem.
      </p>
      <p>
        You have to provide examples of code and expected violations on them.
        The more examples the better.
      </p>
      <p>
        Explain the rationale behind implementing the new check with relevant
        references (if possible).

      <p>
        Feel free to propose a name for the new Check, along with all its attributes.
