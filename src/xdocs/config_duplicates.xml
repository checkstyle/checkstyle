<span class="xdocspagetitle">Duplicate code</span> detection allows you to find
code that has been generated by Copy/Paste programming. Duplicate code typically
leads to higher maintainance cost because bugs will need to be fixed twice,
more code needs to be tested, etc.
</p>
<p>
There are many trade-offs when writing a duplicate code detection tool.
Some of the conflicting goals are:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Fast</li>
<li>Low memory usage</li>
<li>Avoid false alarms</li>
<li>Support multiple/arbitrary languages (Java, JSP, C++, ...)</li>
<li>Support Fuzzy matches (comments, whitespace, linebreaks, variable renaming, etc.)</li>
</ul>

<p>
The check provided here, StrictDuplicateCode, is fast enough to facilitate checking very large code
bases in acceptable time (minutes). It consumes very little memory, false
alarms are not impossible but a really rare case. While it supports multiple
languages it does not support fuzzy matches (that's why it's called Strict).
</p>
<p>
Note that there are brilliant commercial implementations of duplicate code
detection tools. One that is particularly noteworthy is
<a href="http://www.redhillconsulting.com.au/products/simian/">Simian</a>
from RedHill Consulting, Inc.
Simian has managed to find a very good balance of the above tradeoffs.
It is superior to the checks in this package in many repects.
Simian is reasonably priced (free for noncommercial projects)
and includes a Checkstyle plugin.

The following table summarizes the characteristics of the available
Checkstyle plugins for duplicate code detection:

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Name</th>
    <th>Speed</th>
    <th>Memory Usage</th>
    <th>False Alarms</th>
    <th>Supported languages</th>
    <th>Fuzzy matches</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>StrictDuplicateCode</td>
    <td>Medium</td>
    <td>Very Low</td>
    <td>Possible but very unlikely</td>
    <td>any language</td>
    <td>No</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Simian</td>
    <td>Very high</td>
    <td>Low</td>
    <td>Possible but very unlikely</td>
    <td>many languages, including Java and C/C++/C#</td>
    <td>Limited support</td>

We encourage all users of Checkstyle to evaluate Simian as an
alternative to the Checks we offer in our distribution.

</p><section name="StrictDuplicateCode">
<p>
 Performs a line-by-line comparison of all code lines and reports
 duplicate code if a sequence of lines differs only in
 indentation.  All import statements in Java code are ignored, any
 other line - including javadoc, whitespace lines between methods,
 etc. - is considered (which is why the check is called
 <em>strict</em>).
