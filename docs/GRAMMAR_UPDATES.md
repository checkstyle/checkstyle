# Java Grammar Update Process

This document outlines the procedures for updating the Java grammar and
integrating new language features into Checkstyle.

## Prerequisites

There are some tools and concepts that you should be familiar with before
updating the Java grammar:

- [ANTLR4](https://www.antlr.org/)
- Basic knowledge of lexers and parsers
- [Java Language Specification (JLS)](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se22/html/index.html)
- [EBNF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extended_Backus%E2%80%93Naur_form)

## Basics

A few basics to understand:

- **Lexer**: A lexer is a program that performs lexical analysis. It takes the
  input text and converts it into tokens. Our lexer grammar is
  defined [here](https://github.com/checkstyle/checkstyle/blob/master/src/main/resources/com/puppycrawl/tools/checkstyle/grammar/java/JavaLanguageLexer.g4).
- **Parser**: A parser is a program that performs syntax analysis. It takes the
  tokens generated by the lexer and constructs a parse tree. Our parser grammar
  is
  defined [here](https://github.com/checkstyle/checkstyle/blob/master/src/main/resources/com/puppycrawl/tools/checkstyle/grammar/java/JavaLanguageParser.g4).
- **Parse Tree**: A parse tree is a tree representation of the syntactic structure
  of the source code. It is generated by the parser. We do not use the parse tree
  directly in Checkstyle, but we use the parser to generate the parse tree and
  then visit the parse tree to build our Abstract Syntax Tree (AST).
- **Abstract Syntax Tree (AST)**: An AST is a tree representation of the
  syntactic structure of the source code. We build our AST by visiting the parse
  tree generated by the parser. We use the AST to perform static analysis.
- **Token**: A token is a single element of the source code. For example, a
  keyword, an identifier, a literal, etc. We define tokens in our lexer grammar.
- **Token Type**: A token type is a category of tokens. For example, `IDENT`
  is a token type that includes all identifiers in the source code. We define
  token types in our lexer grammar.
- **Parser Rule**: A parser rule is a rule that defines the syntax of the
  programming language. For example, a class declaration.
- **Parser Rule Context**: A parser rule context is a context in which a parser
  rule is applied, and contains information about the source code that matches
  the parser rule. We use parser rule contexts to build our AST.
- **Visitor**: A visitor is a design pattern that allows us to separate the
  algorithm from the object structure. We use a visitor to traverse the parse
  tree and build our AST.
- **JavaAstVisitor**: A visitor that we use to traverse the parse tree and build
  our AST. We define our
  visitors [here](https://github.com/checkstyle/checkstyle/blob/master/src/main/java/com/puppycrawl/tools/checkstyle/JavaAstVisitor.java).

## Java Grammar Update Procedure

Let's walk through an example of updating the Java grammar to support a new language feature. We
will use the `when`
expression as an example: https://openjdk.org/jeps/441.

### Review the JEP and JLS

It is good to first take some time to read the JEP to understand the new language feature.
The JEP provides detailed information about the goals and motivations behind the new feature,
And help us to come up with good testing strategies.

It is also important to review the Java Language Specification (JLS) to understand the syntax
and semantics of the new language feature. The JLS provides the formal definition of the Java
programming language and is the ultimate reference for language features.

The JLS defines the `when` expression as follows (surrounding context provided for clarity):

```txt
SwitchBlock:
  { SwitchRule {SwitchRule} }
  { {SwitchBlockStatementGroup} {SwitchLabel :} }

SwitchRule:
  SwitchLabel -> Expression ;
  SwitchLabel -> Block
  SwitchLabel -> ThrowStatement

SwitchBlockStatementGroup:
  SwitchLabel : {SwitchLabel :} BlockStatements

SwitchLabel:
  case CaseConstant {, CaseConstant}
  case null [, default]
  case CasePattern {, CasePattern} [Guard]
  default

CaseConstant:
  ConditionalExpression

CasePattern:
  Pattern

Guard:
  when Expression
```

### Identify New Tokens and Update Lexer Grammar

Not every new language feature requires new tokens. But in the case of the `when` expression,
we need to introduce a new token to represent the `when` keyword. This requires an update
to the lexer grammar.

```antlr
LITERAL_WHEN : 'when' ;
```

Notes:

- We preface literal tokens with `LITERAL_` to distinguish them from other tokens.
- Lexer rules are written in uppercase by convention.

We will also need to add a
new [TokenType](https://github.com/checkstyle/checkstyle/blob/master/src/main/java/com/puppycrawl/tools/checkstyle/api/TokenTypes.java)
in this case. However, we may not need to always add a token type for every new lexer token, it
depends on the use case. An example would be the `LCURLY` (left curly) token, which is used to
represent the `{`. This token is also a `SLIST` (statement list) in certain contexts. This greatly
eases static analysis, since we do not need to differentiate between the two tokens by checking
their context in checks. Token "reuse" is a common pattern, and helps to avoid code duplication and
having an unnecessarily large number of token types.

### Update Parser Grammar

Next, we need to update the parser grammar to understand in what contexts the new tokens should
appear. We need to add a new parser rule for the `when` expression. The `when` expression is
used in the context of a guard in a switch statement or switch expression. We need to update
the `guard` rule to recognize the `when` expression.

```antlr
guardedPattern
    : primaryPattern guard expression
    ;

// we use the `LAND` token to represent the logical `&&` operator
guard: ( LAND | LITERAL_WHEN );
```

Notes:

- Parser rules are written in lower camel case by convention.
- It is important to consider how many subrules are needed to represent the new language feature.
  Due to the recursive nature of parsing, Stackoverflow errors can occur if the grammar is too
  complex with too many subrules.
- It is good
  to try to strike a balance between the number of subrules, the complexity of the grammar, and the
  complexity of JavaAstVisitor to ease maintenance.

### Update JavaAstVisitor

Now, our lexer recognizes the `when` keyword, and our parser recognizes the `when` expression. We
have updated
TokenTypes to include `LITERAL_WHEN`. At this point, we are able to parse the new syntax, however,
the new tokens
will not appear in the AST unless we update the JavaAstVisitor. This is because our ANTLR grammar
provides us with a parse tree, which we use the JavaAstVisitor to traverse and build our AST.

```java
@Override
public DetailAstImpl visitGuardedPattern(JavaLanguageParser.GuardedPatternContext ctx) {
    // since the `guard` rule is a terminal rule, we need to create a new AST node for it
    final DetailAstImpl guardAstNode = flattenedTree(ctx.guard());
    // we add the children of the `primaryPattern` and `expression` rules to the AST node
    guardAstNode.addChild(visit(ctx.primaryPattern()));
    guardAstNode.addChild(visit(ctx.expression()));
    return guardAstNode;
}
```

Above is an example of the transformation of the `guardedPattern` rule in the JavaAstVisitor. We
create a new AST node for the `guard` rule, and add the children of the `primaryPattern` and
`expression` rules to the AST node. This is a simplified example, and the actual implementation
may vary depending on the complexity of the rule.

Notes:

- When we visit a parser rule context, we have access to all the parse tree elements that
  correspond to that rule. We can use this information to build our AST.
- The structure of the AST should be carefully considered; we want to ease static analysis by
  providing a clear and concise representation of the source code. We can review existing AST
  nodes within other contexts to get an idea of how to structure the AST; however, there is no
  strict rules regarding this topic. This part of the process relies heavily on heuristics and
  experience.
- In many cases, we can consider the ASTs yielded by visiting the subrule of a given rule to be
  the children of the AST node for that rule. This is a common pattern in the JavaAstVisitor; if
  we did not visit the subrule, the AST would not get built.

### Update Tests

Finally, we need to update our tests to ensure that the new language feature is correctly parsed and
analyzed. You
can find our AST
tests [here](https://github.com/checkstyle/checkstyle/tree/master/src/test/java/com/puppycrawl/tools/checkstyle/grammar).

Notes:

- We typically separate tests into directories based on the language level.
- We test the content of the AST only, we generally do not test the actual parse tree.

## Additional Considerations

### DetailAstPair

The `DetailAstPair` class is used to represent a pair of AST nodes. It is used in
the `JavaAstVisitor` to
represent the nested parent-child relationship between AST nodes, especially where there is
recursive nesting of only two to three types of tokens. An example of this is the `qualifiedName`
rule, where the parent node is a `DOT` token and the child nodes are `IDENT` tokens. We use
`DetailAstPair` to represent this relationship in the JavaAstVisitor#visitQualifiedName method.

### Imaginary Tokens

We often create "Imaginary tokens" to represent the structure of the source code. These tokens are
not directly generated by the lexer (or parser in most cases) but are used to represent the
structure of the source code in the AST, and ease the process of static analysis. An example of this
is the `EXPR` token; no such token is generated by the lexer, but it is used to represent
expressions in the AST to make it easy for checks to find and analyze expressions.

Notes:

- Imaginary tokens are not always necessary, and should be used judiciously.
- Imaginary tokens take on the column and line number of the first child token in the AST.

### Why we don't use the parse tree directly

ANTLR generates a parse tree that represents the syntactic structure of the source code. We could
use this parse tree directly to perform static analysis. However, we use the parse tree to build our
AST because it provides a more structured representation of the source code that is easier to
analyze. The AST is designed specifically for static analysis and provides a more convenient
interface for writing checks; it abstracts away the details of the parse tree and provides a
simplified view of the source code.
