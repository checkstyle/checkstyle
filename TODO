TODO LIST:

Add Features:
=============

  Note: 
  This list might be outdated, for an up to date list visit
  http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?atid=397081&group_id=29721&func=browse

o Detect unused Javadoc comments

o Do more rigorous QA on the Javadoc tags. Things to check are:
    - Tags all start at the correct location
    - Tags that are missing information. For example "@param size".
    - Incorrect tags
    - Tags in the wrong location. For example tags for serialised form make
      no sense in a method comment.

o Code after {}'s. Two examples are:
    } x = y + 1;
    { y = x + 1;

o Allow the error message format to be defined.

o Make the handling of dates in the header smarter that just ignoring a single
  line.


Fix known bugs:
===============

  Note:

  http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=29721&atid=397078

o Cannot correctly determine the starting line number for a method with no
  modifiers ("static", "private", etc). For example the method
    int getLine().

o Incorporate known Java Grammer bugs outlined in the article
  http://groups.yahoo.com/group/antlr-interest/message/2687.
